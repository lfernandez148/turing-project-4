# AI Capstone project - AI Engineering

Welcome to the **Advanced LLM Application Development Capstone Project**! This project is designed to empower learners with practical skills for building, deploying, and optimizing applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). 

You will apply your knowledge of APIs, embeddings, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), AI agents, and ethical AI development to create impactful solutions in real-world scenarios.  

This module is more open-ended, allowing you to choose on which **case** to focus for your graded project.  

**Additionally, it will be updated periodically with more examples and suggestions.** 


# Objective:



* Immerse yourself in the community; discuss with STLs and peers
* Develop and deploy prototypes using LLM APIs, LangChain, and RAG.
* Gain hands-on experience with tools like Streamlit, ChromaDB, and vector databases.
* Master prompt engineering and function calling techniques for tailored LLM outputs.
* Prepare for roles in AI/ML or as technical startup founders.

**Before proceeding, keep in mind that it is highly recommended to engage with our community on Discord or participate in the available workshops and open sessions for this module.**

**Important**:
You should create a readme.md file in the project folder including a clear description of the project’s purpose and what it achieves — readme.md file should include a paragraph to concisely explain the goal of their project, the problem it solves, and how it works.

# Case 6: Dig deeper into more advanced topics or tools.

After completing the AI Engineering main module, you may have noticed topics that felt particularly challenging or areas you didn’t have enough time to fully explore. If you choose to continue with this case, you can focus on one complex topic or several of them. Use this opportunity to deepen your understanding, gather new information, and explore ways to apply these concepts to your work environment. You can also document how the selected topics might be relevant for your personal or professional growth.

**Steps:**



1. **Select a Topic** \
   Identify one or more topics you want to explore in greater depth, either from the previous module or beyond the program’s scope, as long as it relates to AI. Alternatively, you can choose from the tasks and examples provided below.
2. **Documentation** \
   Take notes or create a plan, especially if the topic involves building or improving something for your work. If time permits, you can even start creating or implementing your idea.
3. **Submit Your Outcome** \
   Share a brief document summarizing your notes, conclusions, a step-by-step plan for a future outcome, or even an applied final result. Remember, you can also use [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) for that.

**Note:** If your work-related project cannot be shared due to security reasons, simply provide a brief descriptive document explaining the outcome.


# Case 7: LLM Performance Tuning

**Objective**: Evaluate the effects of tuning LLM parameters (e.g., temperature, top-p, max tokens) on output quality.

2. **Experimentation**:
    - Run the same prompts with varied parameters and analyze the outputs.
3. **Insights**:
    - Identify best practices for optimizing LLM outputs for specific use cases.
4. **Create a dataset with your findings**
    - Create a CSV or other dataset with your experiments, inputs, outputs and parameters.

**Outcome**: Create a small presentation and have a good knowledge of various parameters.
